# Association Rule Learning Models Comparison

This repository contains a collection of association rule learning algorithms implemented in Python, including:

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Apriori**: An algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. It uses a breadth-first search strategy to generate candidate itemsets and filter them based on a minimum support threshold.

- **Eclat**: An algorithm for frequent itemset mining that utilizes a depth-first search strategy. It is often more efficient than Apriori for large datasets due to its use of a vertical data format and intersection operations.

## Project Overview

This project aims to compare the performance of different association rule learning algorithms on various datasets. The goal is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and provide insights into their effectiveness for discovering association rules. By analyzing the results, you'll gain a better understanding of which algorithm is more suitable for different types of data and support thresholds.
